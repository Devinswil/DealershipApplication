# Dealership Application

## Description of the Project

My dealership application gives users the ability to filter search through dealerships inventories. Each filter will allow for the users to give the console their search requirements and will be shown vehicles according to that.



## User Stories

-As a user I would like to be able to remove vehicles from inventory.
-As a user I would like to be able to search within a certain price range. This will save me time from looking through the whole inventory.
-As a user I would like to be able to search only by the make and model of vehicles. This will save the time of looking at cars I don't want.
-As a user I would like to be able to search within a certain year range.
-As a user I would like to be able to add vehicles into the inventory.
-As a user I would like to be able to see all the vehicles without having any filters applied.
-As a user I would like to be able to search for vehicles that have a certain number of miles.
-As a user I would like to be able to search for vehicles by the type (car,truck,SUV,van).

## Setup

The application while ask for an input with corresponding action. Once given an input it will display a filtered version o the inventory or will prompt to add or remove vehicle.
